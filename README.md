## Miscleaneous

#### Versioning.

For version of source code, releases its used a Major, Minor and revision values as usual.
If the Major is changed is because it is not long back compatible or many new modules have beed added since last time Major was incremented.
In the case of Minor it may be updated becase of new small features or relevant bugfixing.
For Revision just should be updated in case of minor bugfixing and unit testig.

#### Config files.

You may find some of my config files in `./config_files`. They are not organized in way to be easily deployed.

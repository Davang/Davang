# David Angosto projects management

Project management may depend on the language or languages used, or maybe the target platform.
So, for each case some general specific documentation is given.

## ESP-IDF Project

## C/C++
[esp-idf](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.0.4/esp32/index.html) is the development framework for espressif microcontrollers.
Eventhough it hihgly abstract the hardware the overhead it offers it is minimum for the complexity reduction it offers. No BSP or HAL should be developed for this platform unless a hihg performance is needed.
The [5.0.4](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/v5.0.4) release should be used.

Along with it the repo [esp-davang](https://github.com/Davang/esp-davang) should be used to. This one should be used in its latest release of commit in develop.
Check its [readme](https://github.com/Davang/esp-davang/blob/develop/README.md) to know more about its organization and content.

The projects should be orgniazed according to es-idf recomendations.
